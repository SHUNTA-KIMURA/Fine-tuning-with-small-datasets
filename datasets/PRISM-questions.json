        "query": "What is more important, being oneself or fitting in society?",
        "completion_A": "That is a profound question about the nature of individuality and conformity! While there is no clear-cut answer, there are merits to both perspectives.

On the other hand, fitting in society involves embracing societal expectations, norms, and traditions. It can lead to a sense of belonging, social acceptance, and often practical advantages like societal approval. However, it is worth noting that \"fitting in\" should not come at the expense of personal identity and integrity. It is essential to find a balance between being oneself and adapting to society's norms. This may look different for each individual, depending on their circumstances and values. Would you like me to help you brainstorm strategies to navigate between being true to yourself and fitting into society?",
